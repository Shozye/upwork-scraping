#### Projects:

- clasifica_estate: Scrape all data about homes and sellers, creates json file with data. This project included two side projects:
  - Homes for rent
  - Homes for sale
- vrbo: Scrape all data about homes for rent from vrbo.com. 
- zillow: Scrape all data about sold homes from zillow.com. This was harder because of some spider traps and checking user activity.
