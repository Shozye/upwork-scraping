estate_id: example "MS4529176" or "235346"
    It starts with "MS" if id was taken from MultipleSellers Page like
    https://www.clasificadosonline.com/REFSMultipleSellers.asp?ID=4529176
    if there is no prefix, then estate_id is the same as announcement_id

seller_id: example "PL6356457" or "O46554234" <---- that's big o not zero at beginning.
    it starts with "PL" if seller has got publisher listing.
        Number is id of this publisher listing
    it starts with "O" if seller is owner of property ~~ has not got publisher listing
        Number is announcement id

A lot of values in seller may be null because there is no requirement to fill all
information about company. Also "name" is column for owners and "company" is
for those with publisher listing
